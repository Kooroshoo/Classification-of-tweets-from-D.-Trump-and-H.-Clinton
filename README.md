# Classification of tweets from D. Trump and H. Clinton

Solve a classification task using Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn over some given dataset.

The task is to choose a dataset, train a classifier on the training set and predict the labels on the test set.

For this assignment I chose the classification of tweets from D. Trump and H. Clinton. And I use Multinomial Naive Bayes for Learning.
